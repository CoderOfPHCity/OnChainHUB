This project aims to develop a Decentralized Real Estate Trading Platform that enables users to speculate on and trade city indices representing real estate markets. The platform will use blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and accessibility, allowing users to engage in trading without the need to own physical properties.

## About
ONCHAINHUB offers users enhanced flexibility in trading various property indices that have been transformed into NFTs. Initially, the valuation of each NFT mirrors the price of its corresponding physical property. However, due to the dynamics of virtual trading, while the starting price of each NFT is equivalent to the actual property, it may fluctuate based on user interactions. The prices of the NFT properties will vary as different users engage in buying or selling these tokens, influencing their market value.



#### ONCHAINHUB: The structure
![Screenshot from 2024-04-20 15-37-06](https://github.com/WebSculptor/decentralized-real-estate-trading-platform/assets/137540755/ba5823d1-2702-4895-9868-c7ca415e7d13)

The schema includes fields for ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, which serve as our payment and trading mechanisms respectively. The ERC20 token is essential for tokenizing the system, requiring users to possess this token to participate in governance. On the other hand, the ERC721 token represents the NFT, as previously mentioned, which facilitates the conversion of listed real estate into NFTs. This allows users the flexibility to trade these NFTs, and due to the nature of ERC721,  users can  buy and sell shares of a single real estate NFT.

lt, each DAO must be registered specifically for each state and region. This necessity arises because different states have their own unique land and property regulations. By having separate DAOs for different states, ONCHAINHUB can accommodate the varied requirements of listed properties from different regions, ensuring a flexible and secure platform.
